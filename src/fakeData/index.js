The wavy water of Bay of Bengal touches the beach throughout this 120 km.For Bangladeshi's it doesn't get much better than Cox's Bazar, the country's most popular beach town than the other one 'Kuakata beach town. It's sort of a Cancun of the east. It's choc-a-bloc with massive well-architectured concrete structures, affluent 5 & 3 star hotels, catering largely to the country's elite and overseas tourists. The beach is only a bit crowded in tourist season, October to March, especially near the hotel-motel zone, but remains virgin during the rest of the year, April to September, when it's better to take a trip there.",
